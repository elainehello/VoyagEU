API Integration Practice Notes
-----------------------------

- This module demonstrates how to consume third-party APIs (Booking.com, Kiwi) using Python.
- Steps typically include:
  1. Load API credentials from environment variables for security.
  2. Build the request URL and headers as required by the API.
  3. Make HTTP requests using httpx or requests.
  4. Parse the JSON response and extract relevant data.
  5. Handle errors gracefully (timeouts, invalid responses, etc.).
  6. Optionally, store or cache results for later use.

- This pattern is reusable for any external API:
  - Define a function for each endpoint you need.
  - Keep parsing logic separate for clarity and testing.
  - Use environment variables for sensitive information.

- This is a core skill for backend and full-stack developers.
